PROJECT OVERVIEW
This research examines gender-based wage inequality and workplace
disparities in India. It focuses on labour force participation and
structural barriers faced by women despite equal pay legislation.

The study uses NFHS-5 data to analyze how age, education, residence,
and state-level factors influence labour force participation.

DATA SOURCE
- National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), 2019–21
- Government of India (IIPS & ICF)

METHODOLOGY
- Quantitative research approach
- Linear Regression (OLS)
- Logistic Regression
- Statistical analysis using STATA
- Sample size: 57,693 observations

KEY VARIABLES
Dependent Variable:
- Labour Force Participation (v714)

Independent Variables:
- Age (mv012)
- Education Level (mv133)
- Type of Residence (v025)
- State of Residence (v101)

KEY FINDINGS
- Age positively affects labour force participation
- Higher education shows lower participation due to delayed entry
- Urban residents have better employment opportunities
- Significant state-wise variation exists
- Gender gaps persist despite education and urbanisation

CONCLUSION
Gender wage inequality in India is driven by socio-cultural norms,
institutional barriers, and uneven access to opportunities.
Inclusive labour policies, flexible work arrangements, and
state-specific strategies are essential for gender equity.
